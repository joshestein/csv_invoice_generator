I have a friend who is a doctor who currently:

1. Writes down patient information, diagnostic codes, further notes by hand
2. Creates .docx files that are weirdly formatted with the information

This is a quick way to help them out.

We parse the patient information from the input CSV file. Doctor information is
stored in .env. PDFs are generated using weasyprint.
